# Data Structure and Algorithm in Java

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Java. The purpose of this project is to provide a solid foundation for understanding key concepts in computer science, including how various data structures and algorithms work under the hood.


## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:


- **`datastructures/`**: Contains implementations of data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.
- **`algorithms/`**: Includes sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and searching algorithms like Binary Search, etc.
- **`test/`**: Unit tests for data structures and algorithms.
